# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Survey.fatihoune.com, a modern survey creation and management platform. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack from frontend UI to backend services and database design.

This unified approach combines frontend and backend architecture concerns, streamlining the development process for a modern fullstack application where these concerns are tightly integrated through Next.js's unified framework.
