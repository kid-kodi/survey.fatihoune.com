# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- **CSP Headers:** Content-Security-Policy configured via next.config.mjs to restrict script sources and prevent XSS
  ```
  default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
  ```
- **XSS Prevention:** All user inputs sanitized via DOMPurify before rendering HTML; React's built-in escaping for JSX
- **Secure Storage:** Sensitive data never stored in localStorage; HTTP-only cookies for sessions

**Backend Security:**
- **Input Validation:** All API inputs validated with Zod schemas before processing
- **Rate Limiting:** Upstash Rate Limit or custom middleware limiting to 100 requests/minute per IP for public endpoints, 1000 requests/minute for authenticated endpoints
- **CORS Policy:**
  ```typescript
  {
    origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS?.split(',') || ['http://localhost:3000'],
    credentials: true
  }
  ```

**Authentication Security:**
- **Token Storage:** Session tokens stored in HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite=Lax cookies
- **Session Management:** Sessions expire after 7 days of inactivity; refresh on each request
- **Password Policy:** Minimum 8 characters, requires at least one number and one special character; passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 12)

**Database Security:**
- **Parameterized Queries:** All queries through Prisma ORM using parameterized queries (SQL injection prevention)
- **Encryption at Rest:** PostgreSQL configured with encryption at rest (via cloud provider or LUKS for self-hosted)
- **Connection Security:** Database connections over SSL/TLS only

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- **Bundle Size Target:** Initial bundle < 200KB gzipped (achievable via code splitting and tree shaking)
- **Loading Strategy:**
  - Critical CSS inlined
  - Code splitting by route with Next.js automatic splitting
  - Lazy loading for analytics charts (Recharts) and non-critical components
  - Image optimization via Next.js `<Image>` component
- **Caching Strategy:**
  - Static assets cached with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
  - API responses cached with tanstack/react-query (5-minute stale time for survey lists, 1-minute for analytics)
  - Service Worker for offline survey viewing (Phase 2)

**Backend Performance:**
- **Response Time Target:**
  - Survey list: < 200ms
  - Survey detail: < 150ms
  - Response submission: < 300ms
  - Analytics aggregation: < 500ms
- **Database Optimization:**
  - Indexes on frequently queried columns (userId, surveyId, uniqueId, status)
  - Connection pooling via Prisma (pool size: 10 connections)
  - Query optimization with Prisma's `select` and `include` to fetch only needed fields
  - Pagination for large datasets (50 responses per page)
- **Caching Strategy:**
  - Redis cache for aggregated analytics (15-minute TTL) - Phase 2
  - In-memory cache for survey templates (LRU cache, max 100 items)
  - Database query result caching via Prisma Accelerate (future consideration)
