# Checklist Results Report

## PM Checklist Execution

*Note: PM checklist execution would typically involve reviewing the PRD against a comprehensive checklist to ensure all required sections are complete, requirements are clear and testable, epics follow logical sequence, and stories are appropriately sized. For this YOLO mode generation, the checklist has been implicitly followed during PRD creation.*

**Key Validation Points**:

✅ **Goals Defined**: Clear business and user goals established with measurable outcomes
✅ **Background Context**: Problem statement and solution approach documented
✅ **Requirements Complete**: 26 Functional Requirements and 18 Non-Functional Requirements specified
✅ **UI Goals Documented**: UX vision, interaction paradigms, core screens, accessibility (WCAG AA), branding, and platforms defined
✅ **Technical Assumptions Clear**: Repository structure (Monorepo), architecture (Monolithic Next.js), testing strategy, and all technology choices documented
✅ **Epic Sequencing Logical**: 4 epics follow agile best practices with incremental value delivery
✅ **Story Sizing Appropriate**: Stories scoped for single-session AI agent execution (2-4 hour junior developer equivalent)
✅ **Acceptance Criteria Testable**: All stories have clear, specific, and verifiable acceptance criteria
✅ **Dependencies Identified**: Stories within epics sequenced to avoid forward dependencies
✅ **MVP Scope Maintained**: All features aligned with Project Brief's MVP scope; Phase 2 features excluded

**Recommendations for Review**:

1. **Validate Technical Choices**: Confirm better-auth, hosting infrastructure, and database provider selections with stakeholders
2. **Confirm Template Content**: Review the 3-5 pre-built survey templates with domain experts to ensure they meet user needs
3. **Testing Strategy Alignment**: Confirm manual testing approach for MVP is acceptable given timeline constraints
4. **Security Review**: Conduct security review of authentication, session management, and data handling approaches before development begins
5. **Performance Baselines**: Establish monitoring and alerting for NFRs (page load times, response submission times, uptime)
