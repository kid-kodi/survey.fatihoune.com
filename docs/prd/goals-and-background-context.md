# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable users to create professional surveys within 10 minutes without technical expertise
- Deliver real-time response collection and basic analytics for data-driven decision making
- Provide a mobile-responsive experience for both survey creators and respondents (70%+ completion rate)
- Achieve 60%+ 30-day user retention rate and 1,000 registered users within 6 months
- Support export of survey responses to CSV format for external analysis
- Establish a modern, scalable technical foundation using Next.js 16, React 19, and TypeScript
- Maintain platform performance with page loads under 2 seconds and 99.5%+ uptime

## Background Context

Survey.fatihoune.com addresses critical pain points in existing survey tools: complexity overload, poor user experience, limited flexibility, and fragmented workflows. Organizations and individuals need to collect feedback quickly but are frustrated by legacy platforms with steep learning curves and outdated interfaces that result in delayed decision-making, lower response rates, increased costs, and lost insights.

This PRD defines the MVP for a modern survey platform that balances simplicity with power, targeting small-to-medium businesses (primary segment) and academic researchers (secondary segment) who value ease of use, speed, and modern design. Built on Next.js 16, React 19, and TypeScript with shadcn/ui components, the platform will deliver exceptional performance while maintaining a streamlined user experience from survey creation to response analysis. The MVP focuses on core survey workflows—create, distribute, collect, and analyze—with a timeline of 8-12 weeks to beta launch.
