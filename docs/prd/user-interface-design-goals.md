# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The platform embraces a clean, modern, and intuitive design philosophy that prioritizes user efficiency and reduces cognitive load. The interface should feel familiar to users of modern web applications, with clear visual hierarchy, ample whitespace, and contextual guidance. Survey creators should experience a smooth, linear workflow from creation to analysis, while survey respondents should encounter minimal friction and distractions. The design should instill confidence and professionalism, reflecting the quality of insights users can gather.

- **Contextual Actions**: Hover states and dropdown menus for question-level operations (edit, duplicate, delete)
- **Toast Notifications**: Non-intrusive feedback for save operations, errors, and success states

- **Tab Navigation**: For switching between survey builder, responses, and analytics views
