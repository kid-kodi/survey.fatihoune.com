## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

This is the first story in Epic 7: Marketing Website & Landing Pages. This epic transforms the platform from an application-only product into a complete SaaS offering with professional marketing presence.

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **React**: 19
- **TypeScript**: 5.x
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.x
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (New York style)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **i18n**: next-intl (based on existing Epic 6 implementation)

### Source Tree

- Landing page: `app/page.tsx` (root route)
- Marketing components: `components/marketing/` directory
- Translations: `locales/en.json` and `locales/fr.json`

### Design Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- Follow shadcn/ui New York style conventions
- Use `cn()` utility from `lib/utils.ts` for className merging
- Gradient backgrounds should use brand colors (reference existing theme)
- Responsive breakpoints: mobile-first approach with `md:` and `lg:` variants

### Integration Points

- Links to `/register` (Epic 1: Authentication)
- Links to `/pricing` (Epic 6: Subscriptions & Billing)
- Uses existing i18n setup from Epic 6

### Testing

**Test File Location**: `__tests__/marketing/hero-section.test.tsx`

**Testing Standards**:
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Test responsive behavior with viewport mocking
- Test i18n key rendering for both EN and FR
- Verify navigation links work correctly
- Test smooth scroll functionality

**Testing Frameworks**:
- Jest for test runner
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock next-intl for i18n testing
