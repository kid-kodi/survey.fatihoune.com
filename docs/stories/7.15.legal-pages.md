### Table of Contents Implementation

```typescript
// components/legal/table-of-contents.tsx
'use client'

const sections = [
  { id: 'data-collection', title: 'Data Collection' },
  { id: 'data-usage', title: 'Data Usage' },
  // ...
]

export function TableOfContents() {
  return (
    <nav className="sticky top-20">
      <ul>
        {sections.map(section => (
          <li key={section.id}>
            <a href={`#${section.id}`}>{section.title}</a>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </nav>
  )
}
```

### Last Updated Date

Include at the top of each legal page:
```typescript
const LAST_UPDATED = "November 6, 2025"

export default function PrivacyPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p className="text-muted-foreground">Last Updated: {LAST_UPDATED}</p>
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  )
}
```
