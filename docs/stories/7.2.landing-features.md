## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

This is Story 7.2 in Epic 7: Marketing Website & Landing Pages. This story adds the features section to the landing page created in Story 7.1.

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **React**: 19
- **TypeScript**: 5.x
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.x
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (New York style)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **i18n**: next-intl

### Source Tree

- Features section component: `components/marketing/features-section.tsx`
- Landing page: `app/page.tsx` (add features section below hero)
- Translations: `locales/en.json` and `locales/fr.json`

### Design Guidelines

- Use Tailwind grid: `grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6`
- Feature cards should have subtle hover effects (scale, shadow, border color)
- Use appropriate Lucide icons for each feature (GripVertical, List, BarChart3, Users, Smartphone, Download)
- Follow shadcn/ui card patterns for feature cards

### Suggested Lucide Icons

- Feature 1 (Drag & Drop): `GripVertical` or `Move`
- Feature 2 (Question Types): `List` or `CheckSquare`
- Feature 3 (Analytics): `BarChart3` or `LineChart`
- Feature 4 (Collaboration): `Users` or `UserPlus`
- Feature 5 (Mobile): `Smartphone` or `TabletSmartphone`
- Feature 6 (Export): `Download` or `FileDown`

### Integration Points

- Add to `app/page.tsx` below hero section (Story 7.1)
- Reuse existing i18n setup

### Testing

**Test File Location**: `__tests__/marketing/features-section.test.tsx`

**Testing Standards**:
- Test grid layout at different breakpoints
- Test hover animations using user events
- Verify all 6 features render correctly
- Test i18n key rendering for both EN and FR
- Verify icons render

**Testing Frameworks**:
- Jest for test runner
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock next-intl for i18n testing
