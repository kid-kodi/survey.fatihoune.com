## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

This is Story 7.3 in Epic 7: Marketing Website & Landing Pages. This story adds the "How It Works" process section to the landing page.

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **React**: 19
- **TypeScript**: 5.x
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.x
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (New York style)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **i18n**: next-intl
- **Animation (optional)**: framer-motion

### Source Tree

- How It Works component: `components/marketing/how-it-works-section.tsx`
- Landing page: `app/page.tsx` (add below features section from Story 7.2)
- Translations: `locales/en.json` and `locales/fr.json`

### Design Guidelines

- Use flex layout: `flex flex-col md:flex-row` for responsive switching
- Number indicators should be large and prominent (circle with number)
- Connecting lines on desktop: use border or SVG lines between steps
- Mobile: vertical stack with smaller connectors (optional)
- Use subtle animations for step reveal on scroll (Intersection Observer or framer-motion)

### Suggested Lucide Icons

- Step 1 (Sign Up): `UserPlus`
- Step 2 (Build): `FileEdit` or `Pencil`
- Step 3 (Share): `Share2` or `Send`
- Step 4 (Analyze): `BarChart3` or `TrendingUp`

### Integration Points

- Add to `app/page.tsx` below features section (Story 7.2)
- CTA button links to `/register` (Epic 1: Authentication)
- Reuse existing i18n setup

### Animation Considerations

- Optional: Use Intersection Observer API to trigger animations when section enters viewport
- framer-motion can be used for fade-in and slide-up effects
- Keep animations subtle and non-intrusive

### Testing

**Test File Location**: `__tests__/marketing/how-it-works-section.test.tsx`

**Testing Standards**:
- Test responsive layout switching
- Verify all 4 steps render with correct numbering
- Test CTA button navigation
- Test i18n key rendering for both EN and FR
- Verify icons render correctly

**Testing Frameworks**:
- Jest for test runner
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock next-intl for i18n testing
- Mock Intersection Observer if using scroll animations
